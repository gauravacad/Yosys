## Yosys: A primer on digital circuit synthesis
### About in details of Yosys Usages

- Yosys is specific only for Verilog HDL synthesis tool. 
- This means that it takes a behavioural design description as input and generates an RTL, logical gate or physical gate level description of the design as output.
- Yosysâ€™ main strengths are behavioural and RTL synthesis.
- A wide range of commands (synthesis passes) exist within Yosys that can be used to perform a wide range of synthesis tasks within the domain of behavioural, RTL and logic synthesis.
- Yosys is designed to be extensible and therefore is a good basis for implementing custom synthesis tools for specialised tasks.

### Levels of abstraction

> Digital circuits can be represented at different levels of abstraction. 
> During the design process a circuit is usually first specified using a higher level abstraction.
